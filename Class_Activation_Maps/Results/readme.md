## **Results** ##
<p align="justify"> Figure 1 to Figure 7 represents the implementation of class activation maps on seven different classes given in the dataset. The top image in each figure’s subplot (a) represents the input image, i.e., skin lesion image of size (450, 600, 3). The correct label and the probability assigned to the correct label is written under each image. The bottom image in each figure’s subplot (a) is a bar plot, which denotes three labels considered most probable by the model. The green color represents the correct label, and the red color represents all the other labels in the bar plot. Subplot (b) represents the pre-processed image i.e. normalized in the range [-1, 1]. Subplot (c) represents the heatmap superimposed on the input image using Jet colormap array ranging from blue (low value) to red (high value). The red is the high-intensity area, i.e., the region is very important, and blue indicates the low-intensity area, i.e., the less important region, but still relevant enough to locate the skin lesion.

<p align="justify"> As expected, the trained CNN model is looking for a specific feature. Based on the different morphologic variants such as rash, nodule, pigmentation, irregular patch, cyst on the surface of the skin, or areas of skin that look different from the surrounding area, CNN determines the coarse and irregular portions of a lesion to be important features. These features are used as the basis for its classification of skin lesions. If the predicted probability of the target class is high, then the heatmap on the important features, i.e., the affected area, is more intense. The higher the intensity of the heatmap, the model is surer about the location of the affected area based on these learned features. </p>  

<p align="justify"> A test is conducted to observe the effect on the heatmap generated by different classes that were predicted by the model on the same image. Before the test is conducted on skin lesions, it is first tried on the Dogs vs Cats model. This is because it is easy to verify the results of this test on a simple image. Figure 8 shows the results of this test and highlights the differences in heatmaps generated by CAM for a single image when different classes are used. It can be observed that the heatmap regions for different categories are different in a given image.</p>

<p align="justify">Figure 8(a) shows the input image with ground-truth and its prediction score displayed on top of the image. The ground truth of the input image is cat, and for the given input image, the classifier predicts the cat label with the probability of 0.94 and predicts the label dog with the probability of 0.06. Figure 8(b) displays the heatmap of the predicted label cat. It is observed that for a correct prediction, CAM generates the heatmap on the face of the cat. This indicates that the cat’s face was the decisive factor for CNN to predict the label cat. Figure 8(c) displays the heatmap of the predicted label dog. It is observed that CAM generates the heatmap on the paws of the cat. It indicates that this region was the reason why CNN also predicted the dog class with very low probability.</p>
