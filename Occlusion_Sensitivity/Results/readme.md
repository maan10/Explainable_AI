Figure 1 to Figure 7 represent the implementation of occlusion sensitivity with patch size 32x32 pixel and occluding stride of 16 on seven different classes given in the dataset. The top image in each figure’s subplot (a) represents the input image, i.e., skin lesion image of size (450, 600, 3). The correct label and the probability assigned to the correct label is written under each image. The bottom image in each figure’s subplot (a) is a bar plot, which denotes three labels considered most probable by the model. The green color represents the correct label, and the red color represents all the other labels in the bar plot. Subplot (b) represents the pre-processed image i.e. normalized in the range [-1, 1]. Subplot (c) represents the heatmap superimposed on the input image. As mentioned earlier, Viridis colormap array ranging from blue (darkest regions in the image) to yellow (brightest regions in the image) is used. The bright regions indicate that the patch has not occluded a significant feature, and hence, the probability of the target class is high. The dark regions indicate the locations where occlusion has a significant effect on the probability. In other words, the patch has occluded the feature that is important for the correct classification of the image.
