According to the Global Cancer Statistics 2018, cancer is a prominent cause of death worldwide, with nearly 9.6 million deaths in 2018 [1]. Non-melanoma skin cancer is the fifth most common cancer, with 1.04 million new cases in 2018 [1]. In contrast, Melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, is the 19th most commonly occurring cancer with nearly 300,000 new cases in 2018 [1]. The early detection of Melanoma significantly improves the diagnosis of patients.
